Expand your own version of the Tip Calculator to include the following extra features:

1) Provide UI Toggles for the user to select desired tip percentages e.g. 15%, 18%, or 20%.

2) Display a detailed break down of the bill including the original bill amount without tax, the amount of tax charged based on the selected tax percentage, the total amount including tax and the tip amount selected. Remember that the tip is calculated only on the original bill amount (i.e. subtotal) and not on the amount that includes tax.

3) Feel free to add any other improvements/additions on the app that you feel it will make it more user-friendly and useful. This is your own app!
